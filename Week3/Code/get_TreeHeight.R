# Desc: This script calculates heights of trees from a given .csv file and outputs
# the result in the following format; "InputFileName_treeheights.csv"


#clear environments
rm(list=ls())

# The height is calculated bu using the given distance of each tree from its base 
# and angle to its top, using  the trigonometric formula;
#
# height = distance * tan(radians)


args<-commandArgs(trailingOnly = TRUE) # Defines command line arguments as vector "args"
# By trailingOnly = TRUE, only input file in command line is called
Data<-read.csv(args[1]) # Read csv file
filename <- tools::file_path_sans_ext(args[1]) # establishes a file path without the file extention using tools package
filewithoutext <- basename(filename) # Stores the file without the pathway

#Alternative to commandArgs = would extract any *.csv but difficult to alter extention for output

#Data<-read.csv(filenames, header = TRUE)
#Data<- read.table(filenames, sep = ",", header = TRUE)
