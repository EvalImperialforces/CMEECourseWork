# Author: Eva Linehan
# Date: Oct 2018

The purpose of this repository is to store CMEE required coursework for assessment. Coursework is organised by Week in which coursework for week one will reside in the "Week1" folder. 

In each "Week" folder, coursework is arranged in the 'Data', 'Code', 'Sandbox' and 'Results' folders. The 'Data' folder comprises of data files used in practical exercises and assessments during the week. 'Code' contains code used to execute commands as part of in-class examples and weekly assessments. The 'Sandbox'folder is primarily for storing output files from test examples and the 'Results' folder will contain output files when scripts in 'Code' are executed.
